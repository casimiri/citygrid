# GitHub Codespace Port Configuration

## Current CORS Issue Resolution

The CORS error you're experiencing is due to port visibility settings in GitHub Codespaces, not the backend CORS configuration itself.

## Required Steps:

### 1. Make Ports Public
You need to configure the ports to be publicly accessible:

1. **Open the Ports Panel in VS Code:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
   - Type "Ports: Focus on Ports View"
   - Or use the menu: `Terminal` → `Ports`

2. **Configure Port 3001 (Backend):**
   - Find port 3001 in the ports panel
   - Right-click on port 3001
   - Select "Port Visibility" → "Public"

3. **Configure Port 3002 (Frontend):**
   - Find port 3002 in the ports panel
   - Right-click on port 3002
   - Select "Port Visibility" → "Public"

### 2. Alternative: Use Terminal Command
If you have access to the terminal with GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh codespace ports visibility 3001:public 3002:public
```

### 3. Verify Configuration
After making ports public, test the connection:

```bash
curl -I https://legendary-giggle-w4p4wvg6x39jvj-3001.app.github.dev/api/v1/health
```

You should see a 200 response instead of 401.

## Current Application Status:

✅ **Backend:** Running on port 3001 with CORS allowing all origins
✅ **Frontend:** Running on port 3002
✅ **CORS Config:** Properly configured to allow all Codespace domains
❌ **Port Visibility:** Needs to be set to public (this is the current blocker)

## URLs After Configuration:
- **Frontend:** https://legendary-giggle-w4p4wvg6x39jvj-3002.app.github.dev
- **Backend API:** https://legendary-giggle-w4p4wvg6x39jvj-3001.app.github.dev/api/v1

## Next Steps:
1. Follow the port configuration steps above
2. Test the frontend application
3. Verify admin authentication and "Créer le niveau" functionality works

The CORS configuration is already optimized and will work once the ports are publicly accessible.
